<p>McSkidy and Glitch want to hire an eDiscovery company to process some forensic data for their investigation. They have invited bids from third parties for this purpose. Three companies have bid for the project. McSkidy and Glitch now need to do a risk assessment on all three of these companies to identify the one with the least amount of risk so that they can move forward. All three companies were required to fill out a questionnaire based on which a risk assessment will be done.</p>
